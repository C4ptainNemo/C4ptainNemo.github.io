## Welcome to my GitHub landing page
Here you can find links to various repositories that I have created to act as a portfolio for projects I have worked on, either personal or for university.


### [Small projects](https://github.com/C4ptainNemo/Small-Projects)
This is a collection of small projects that do not warrant a whole repo to themselves.

### [BattleShip built in Python](https://github.com/C4ptainNemo/BattleShip_Python)
This is the classic game BattleShips built in Python and plays in the terminal.
 
### [Planetary Gearbox](https://github.com/C4ptainNemo/Planetary_Gear_Box_Project)
This is a two stage planetary gearbox designed and built for a university project.
